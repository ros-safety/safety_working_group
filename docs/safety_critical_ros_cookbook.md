# Safety-Critical ROS Cookbok

[The Safety-Critical ROS Cookbook](safety_critical_ros_cookbook.html) provides information on how to use ROS as part of building safe robots.
It includes such information as what you must to do to use ROS sufficiently safely for your application, what you must not to to avoid reducing safety, and in what situations extra work may be necessary to use ROS in a safety-critical robot and what that work may involve.
Its intended audience includes companies and developers who will be developing robots with potential safety concerns who want to know why ROS is suitable and how to use it correctly, as well as experienced ROS professionals.
